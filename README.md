# Audiovisual Loops #

## About the research project ##
"Audiovisual Loops" is a research project at [Dalarna University](http://du.se) aimed at exploring the artistic posibilities of using live looping in music. Unlike many established live looping artists this project focuses on a whole ensemble making live loop based music together.

The basic tools for this has been [Ableton Live](http://ableton.com), specifically the *Looper* plugin along with [Behringer FCB 1010 foot controllers](http://www.behringer.com/EN/Products/FCB1010.aspx).

## About the tools in this repository ##
The further the musicians creativity a number of tools needed to be created. The main focus of these tools is to enable all musicians in the ensemble to easily get a view into what's going on in the loop computer.

To achive this we have used [Max for Live](http://cycling74.com/products/maxforlive/) and Max's native abilities to use OSC coupled with the iOS (and Android) app [TouchOSC](http://hexler.net/software/touchosc) from Hexler.

This repository contains the various tools as we develop them.
